# intern--task-3

Task 3 of the cyber security interniship by Elevate labs is to perform a basic vulnerability scan on my PC.

I learnt about what is a vulnerability scanner and common vulnerabilities. I used the Nessus Esssentials tool for scanning my PC for vulnerability. This tool helped me know about some common vulnerabilities, their severity and the solution to avoid it. 

On completing this task, I am not confident in how a vulnerability scan works and protection from some common vulnerabilities.
